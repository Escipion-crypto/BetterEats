# 🍎 Better Eats (Static Held Eating)

A lightweight, client-side Minecraft mod for **Fabric 1.21.5** designed to improve visual clarity during combat and exploration.

## 🚀 Overview
Tired of food items blocking your entire view when you're trying to eat and fight at the same time? **Better Eats** fixes the "face-blocking" eating animation by keeping your held item in its natural, idle position while you consume it.

### Key Features:
* **Clear Visuals:** Removes the animation that moves food to the center of your screen.
* **Static Positioning:** Items stay in the bottom corner of your screen (where they normally sit).
* **Combat Ready:** Perfect for PvP or hardcore survival where seeing your surroundings is life-or-death.
* **Fully Compatible:** Works with all vanilla food/potions and most modded items.
